                <p class="project-description">This is a project I did as my final project in my high school. It was guided by the book <a href="https://natureofcode.com/">The Nature of code</a>. This features a simple site made with only html, and the projects are then written in <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a>. It features various exercises in the book, and then a final project, which is a simple space shooter game where you shoot spaceships.</p>
